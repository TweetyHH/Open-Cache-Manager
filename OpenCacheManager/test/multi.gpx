the first waypoint. The cache is micro -- beware, it is smaller
than a 35mm film container. Since the cache is so small, it only
contains a logbook. Please bring your own pencil! &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
 The Glebe is one of Ottawa’s original suburbs. It became popular
in the late 1800s and early 1900s after the streetcar was built
down Bank Street to Lansdowne Park in 1891. Most of the houses in
the area were built between 1890 and 1940. Much of the
neighbourhood’s original architecture has been maintained over the
years as very few of the original homes or commercial buildings
along Bank Street have been demolished or changed. It is now a
trendy, yet rather expensive, place to live. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 The word "glebe" comes from the Latin word "gleba" which means a
piece of earth. In England, the term came to mean a plot of land
granted to a clergyman or a church. These reserve lands for the
church allowed the clergyman -- or the church -- to make a little
money, either through farming/renting the land, or selling it off.
When Canada was settled, there were many clergy reserves, or
glebes, set aside. The area in Ottawa we now know as the Glebe was
part of the original clergy reserve set aside for St. Andrew's
Presbyterian Church downtown at Kent and Wellington streets. At the
time, the reserve extended from Bronson Avenue on the west to Main
Street on the east between what is now Glebe Avenue and Fifth
Avenue. When the area opened for subdivision development in the
1870s, real estate agents called it ‘The Glebe.’ The boundaries of
the neighbourhood are now considered to be Bronson on the west, the
canal on the south and the east, and the Queensway on the north.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 For a neighbourhood named the Glebe, it’s only fitting that it
should have lots of churches, many of them quite old. This cache
will take you on a tour of them. If you follow the waypoints in
order, you’ll do a little loop -- and probably save some time
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Waypoint #1: N45 24.009 W075 41.584 &lt;br /&gt;
-- How many metal vertical bars are there covering the window to
the right of the doors? This should be a two-digit number. Subtract
three times the first digit from the second to get a single digit.
(e) &lt;br /&gt;
-- How many letters in the first word of this church's name?
Subtract 4 (d) &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Waypoint #2: N45 24.074 W075 41.300 &lt;br /&gt;
-- In what year was the church completed? Take this number and add
all the digits together. The sum should be a two-digit number. Add
those digits together to get a single digit. Multiply this by 2.
(h) &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Waypoint #3: N45 24.044 W075 41.171 &lt;br /&gt;
-- How many letters are in this church's name? This should be a
two-digit number. Subtract 20. (c) &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Waypoint #4: N45 24.181 W075 41.191 &lt;br /&gt;
-- What time is service on Sunday? Add the digits together to get a
single digit. (b) &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Waypoint #5: N45 24.150 W075 41.296 &lt;br /&gt;
-- What is the biggest number on the main sign for this church? (f)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Waypoint #6: N45 24.272 W075 41.341 &lt;br /&gt;
-- What is the number on the corner plaque? What is the third
digit? (a) What is the sum of the third and fourth? (j) The font
for this waypoint is a bit difficult to read, and could yield two
different values for J. J should be a high single digit number, if
you get a double digit number, simply go with the fourth digit.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Waypoint #7: N45 24.279 W075 41.429 &lt;br /&gt;
-- How many glass panes are there in the light above the door? Add
4 to this number. (i) &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Waypoint #8: N45 24.196 W075 41.536 &lt;br /&gt;
-- How many stairs up to the single set of doors? This should be a
two-digit number. Add those digits together to get a single digit.
(g) &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Now you have all the numbers you need to find the cache!&lt;br /&gt;
Substitute your numbers for: N45 ab.cde W075 fg.hij &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 To check your numbers, if you add a+b+c+d+e+f+g+h+i+j, you should
come up with a digital root of 3 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;S11JE7M - Stage 1&lt;br /&gt;N 45° 24.009 W 075° 41.584&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;S21JE7M - Stage 2&lt;br /&gt;N 45° 24.074 W 075° 41.300&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;S31JE7M - Stage 3&lt;br /&gt;N 45° 24.044 W 075° 41.171&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;S41JE7M - Stage 4&lt;br /&gt;N 45° 24.181 W 075° 41.191&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;S51JE7M - Stage 5&lt;br /&gt;N 45° 24.150 W 075° 41.296&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;S61JE7M - Stage 6&lt;br /&gt;N 45° 24.272 W 075° 41.341&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;S71JE7M - Stage 7&lt;br /&gt;N 45° 24.279 W 075° 41.429&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;S81JE7M - Stage 8&lt;br /&gt;N 45° 24.196 W 075° 41.536&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

A perfect after-work-week evening walking in the area. I had attempted this one (or was it its predecessor?) one or two winters ago, screwed up badly, and got nowhere. This evening, I made a small mistake, went to within 50 m of the cache, said "this doesn't make sense", re-did my calculations, and then found the nasty little container. Nice, very nice, Mr. T. Congratulations on a very pleasant setup.

After a lovely afternoon meandering about the Glebe, I calculated my final coordinates, and found my GPS pointing me into someone's yard.

Looked over my work, found a mistake, came up with new coords... in someone's yard.

Used "phone a friend" to check my numbers, and found that I had TWO errors in my work. Went to the final coordinates, located the cache, and discovered that I am too vertically challenged to get it.

Returned a few minutes later with reinforcement, and finally signed the logbook.

Thank you for reviving this cache. I was all set to do the original one when all the DNFs started popping up, and I was quite pleased when you told me you were going to bring it back.</groundspeak:text>
