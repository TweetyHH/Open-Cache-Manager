      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">OLD WINSTON THE ELEPHANT
Old Winston the elephant has an interesting story.  One day Old Winston was just relaxing somewhere in the Ottawa area, when he was kidnapped by a bunch of hooligans.  He was brought to a forest where he enjoyed his new home but old Winston was neglected and some local teenagers abused him and did not treat him right.  One day, the hooligans who kidnapped him decided to return to see how he was doing and felt sorry for the old guy.  They decided to give him a name and it just happened that there was an old cigarette package sitting near the elephant which one could only read "Winston".  From then on the elephant was called Winston and the hooligans grew a liking to Winston and would visit him frequently.  Over the years they would visit him but the visits would spread out over time and Winston was left in the woods all by himself again.  Many years past and one day the hooligans came back to see how he was doing but to their dismay Winston was gone and presumably went on a safari.  A couple more years past and sure enough Winston some how turned up in the most unlikely place, which was in the backyard of one of the hooligans.  The teen, now turned man, fixed Winston up and decided to take him to another place where others can visit Winston and take pictures of him.  Hopefully, Winston will enjoy his new home and many people will visit him and give him some love that he truly deserves.
Please take a picture with Winston and try to bring along some elephant friends to put in the cache box so he can talk to when nobody visits him.</groundspeak:long_description>

Wow, there's an elephant! It didn't look like it with all the snow, but once I shaked it a bit, I could definitely see it!

The coordinates didn't seem very good, but it was a no miss.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">#3148 Found it with MAPSIT at 12:50, and all is in good condition.  We also took the Innis road approach, and parked in the lot at N45 25.800 W075 33.800, then used the trail head at N45 25.740 W075 33.805, using the pedestrian controlled crosswalk to cross the Innis Bypass.  As we were getting ready at the car, putting on out bug hats, nets, gloves, and boots, we met Elyob and Ziggy the wonderdog in the parking lot. They wished us well, before we headed down the mostly level trails to this cache. We liked what you did with the elephant! TNLNSL Thanks Smiling Scott &amp; Happy Jax, for the fun cache, and the nice walk in the woods. The Burrow.</groundspeak:text>

Nice area but  we elected to take a straigt line to the cache, bad idea for a 300m bushwack. Greely Grizzly found the trail on our way out.

Again, we had contemplated going after this from Renaud Rd, but reconsidered and headed to the Innis Bypass. Followed the nice walking trail from the traffic lights.

Well done on the Elephant.

En cette belle journée ensoleillée, une expédition dans le bois était à l’horaire. Avant de découvrir la cache, on m’avait découvert. Les moustiques sont de retour en pleine force. Il y en a partout. Il ne faut surtout pas s’arrêter. Trouver la cache et son gardien sans problème. Quel beau travail pour faire cet éléphant.
Merci Smiling Scott &amp; HappyJax pour la cache.
