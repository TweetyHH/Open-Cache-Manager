&lt;p&gt;On June 21st 1967 at 2:30 EST. a simultaneous dedication in all Capital cities of Canada took place to honour the land surveyors of this country. The twelve Centennial monuments and plaques were unveiled to the public showing the important part the surveyor played in the exploration and mapping of our nation. Each capital city will have a brass cap which is a First Post in a unified system of precisely co-ordinated survey points. Some monuments have a document cache or a time capsule encased to be opened on our 200th birthday. 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The first survey of land in Canada was made in 1625 on the St. Charles River near the City of Quebec and was made by the man recognized as Canada's first surveyor, Samuel de Champlain.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=brown&gt;Geodetic positions in North America were all related to a singular point in Kansas USA. The point known as Meades Ranch was based on the 1927 North American Datum. Canada, United States and Mexico survey systems were all related to this starting point.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.groundspeak.com/cache/27676_200.jpe"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;To Log your find e-mail a description of what is directly east and west of the Brass Cap. You can include pictures of the monument if you'd like.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">At first was thinking that this location might be cordoned off for the winter but then I rethought my route. Think UP!!!   Ta-dah!  Only I didn't find the brass cap.  Not too surprising when the amount of snow was taken into consideration and also the fact that I hadn't looked at the photos/log for this cache for awhile. However,   I'm just surprised that I didn't  TRIP right over it! This is my second first....Post, the other being in Regina SK.  

Yes, I'm curious about the geocoin as mentioned in the previous log.  I swept the snow off the top of the monument thinking that the brass cap may have been there(keep in mind I had not looked at the photos as a memory jogger) but didn't come into contact with anything.  Maybe they put it on top of the brass cap and it was simply brushed off without realizing it.  It'll show up in the spring, I'm sure.  Unless someone has the ambition to dig around in the snow.  Maybe this cacher could leave a note????</groundspeak:text>
