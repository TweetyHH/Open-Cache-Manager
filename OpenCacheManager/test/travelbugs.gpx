&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'&gt;This cache has been
originally set out for GAG9 (&lt;a rel="nofollow" href=
"http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=210b9b9d-6cda-470a-81e6-ddf83bc62509&amp;amp;log=y&amp;amp;decrypt="&gt;
GCYFTG&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'&gt;As such please seek it
after 6 PM Friday 20th October 2006.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'&gt;This cache is designed
to hold BIG stuff.&lt;span style='mso-spacerun:yes'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; It’s
a 5 gallon plastic container that could swallow 500 micros for
lunch.&lt;span style='mso-spacerun:yes'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; Although the
container is pretty full (see the picture of its original
contents), I'm sure a few other monster cache items would fit with
a bit of care.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'&gt;I set it out by bike
but you can park on Cromwell instead and there is an access point
at N45 22.163 W75 40.345.&lt;span style=
'mso-spacerun:yes'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; Beware though that the traffic can
be very bad sometimes and an alternate (longer) approach route can
be had from Walkley (between the Transitway and the Parkway). I
would not recommend parking on the parkway as its probably not
allowed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'&gt;It could be done as a
night cache but don't fall into the river or get run over getting
there!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'&gt;Please snap the lid
back on tightly (its very tight) to keep out water and double bag
everything as it was originally.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'&gt;Have fun and remember
to swap BIG!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

We visited the Big 'O' today.  We noticed the blender (hard not to!) but hadn't read the logs and didn't realize that there was supposed to be a GC stuck to it.  We don't know if it's there or not.  We also did not see the TB that is supposed to be there (unless it's way down in the bottom).

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I have driven by this cache about 1.3 million times. Today I took a nice fall walk, and found it. Bit steep and slippery. The cache contained a blender base, and I only now realize it was a TB. I thought it may be the worst piece of swag I've ever seen. Now I only think it's the worst TB I've ever seen [:)]

Took and left nothing, signed the log.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I made a short dash across the parkway at rush hour and as I got to within 30m of the cache I came across a large recent mudslide which has eroded the hillside. I thought the cache would have been swept away but it has been spared by a few meters. I have had a large traveller to drop off for a couple of months now and the size of this container was perfect. With the popularity of micro containers these days, this was a refreshing find. Thanks!!</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I decided to get this cache with my husband today, during his lunch hour. It turned out to be quite the bushwhack, complete with steep slippery terrain and spiky weeds. Got to a steep drop off and decided to go down the hill on my butt; it turned out to be the wrong way down, so we had to climb back up the slippery slope. Made our way down an easier slope and saw the cache from about 15m away. Took a TB and signed the log. Both of us left with muddy bums. Good thing he was working from home today, as he couldn't go into work looking like that. [:D] TFTC and the little lunch-time adventure!

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Parked on the side of the road as the cache did not appear to be very far in the vegetation. As I was walking towards GZ, I came across a very steep hole, no doubt the inspiration for the cache name. I would not recommend finding this cache at night for this reason. I walked along the edge and after slipping and sliding down the slope, I met the cache head on. This is another cache that is unlikely to be muggled. TNLN TFTCSL </groundspeak:text>

My 60 CSx took longer than usual to track the satellites while I stood beside the Parkway - I would have been standing there all day with old Etrex Legend! [;)] The lid of the container was not fully closed, the handle to the bucket on the ground next to it. (Surprisingly, there was still a fair bit of snow on the banks of Sawmill Creek.) There was no water in the cache, but it did smell musty. I left a new Canada Post stamp kit in a Ziploc bag - I took nothing. As I logged my find, I saw the first mosquito of the season [:O] - damn! I CITO'd a chip bag that was lying next to the container and I placed some natural camo around and on top  of the container so it didn't look so obvious.
